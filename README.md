# How to run this application

install g++ on your ubuntu machine. I have used ubuntu 11.10 to develop this application.

if you are on ubuntu

~~~
  sudo apt-get install g++
~~~

then follow this three steps. Goto your terminal write this

~~~
  make clean
  make
  ./output/advent
~~~

if the application is running successfully, then the server is running. You now need connect to this server using telnet from another terminal prompt.

~~~
  telnet localhost 3333
~~~

This will connect to the server as a client. And you can start playing the game. Enjoy !!!

If you need help running this contact me through github :)
